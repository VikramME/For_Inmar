		Config Management - Ansible
	---------------------------------------

Ansible is used for provisioning, deploy,configure,scale and secure the servers.

Difficult to manage thousands of servers with ansible we can manage easily through ssh configuration.

In ansible we have playbook concept to do the work in easy way and automate.

Smart automation is always worth in the market especially in production.

Ansible we called it as configuration management and project management tool.

simple to start

scales up on demand

No agents are needed.

sshd on remote machine can be used.

Playbook is Infrastructure as code as a file

Module is a resource like file/package/command/service/copy ...etc to configure

Components in Ansible
---------------------
Inventory: file contains list of hosts, groups or variables.

Modules: Actually do the work 

Handlers: call back actions, and other hooks

Playbooks: Collection of plays 

Plays: Loops over a list of takes mapped to list of hosts 

Tasks: Invokes a module to do the work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ansible installation


ssh-key has to setup on the nodes 

Ansible server talks to managed nodes using ssh 

Default location of inventory: /etc/ansible/hosts


structure using ansible

ansible inventory -m modulename

ansible-playbook playbook.yml

add hosts in /etc/ansible/hosts

add groups of hosts in this file

we have to generate ssh keys and setup password less authentication between server and clients 

---------------------------------------------------------------

some of ansible commands


ansible all -m ping 

ansible all -a "touch /tmp/hello"

ansible all -i "localhost" -c local -m shell -a 'echo hello vikram'   --> local execution

ansible all -i"ctxx1p3435" -m shell -a 'echo hello vikram' -->remote execution

ansible webservers -m ping

cat sample.yml

---
- hosts: webservers
  become:yes

  tasks:
  - name: install httpd
    yum: pkg=httpd state=installed

    notify:
      -	restart apache 

     -name: start service
      service: name=httpd state=started

     handlres:
      -name:restart apache
       action:service name=httpd state=restarted


============================================================================================================================

For CI / CD i do use Jenkins 

in jenkins i will configure ansible and do run jobs in it.
